# Project-2

## Part 1: Implementing the search algorithm only  

* Greedy forward that starts with empty set of selection then iteratively increase the number of feature.
* Using evalutaion function to find a score of each node : use a stub evaluation function that returns a random value
* Pirnt out the highest score at each step.
* Backward-elimination is very similar: it starts with the full, set of features and removes one feature at a time.
